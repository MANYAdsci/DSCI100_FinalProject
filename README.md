Iris Species Classification project using the Iris Flower Dataset to predict flower species from sepal and petal dimensions. Employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification, achieving 96% accuracy with petal-based and combined models, emphasising petal characteristics' role in distinguishing Iris species.
